<p>1.Your Relationship with Us</p>
<p>Welcome to Samurai Slice (the &ldquo;Game&rdquo;), which is provided by Mulberry Software SRL (&ldquo;MSS&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo;).</p>
<p>You are reading the terms of service (the &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;), which govern the relationship and serve as a legally binding agreement between you and us and set forth the terms and conditions by which you may access and use the Game, the mobile application, the software embedded therein, the features and functions thereof and our related websites, services, applications, products and content (collectively, the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;). Any reference to the &ldquo;Services&rdquo; includes a reference to any part of the Services. For purposes of these Terms, &ldquo;you&rdquo; and &ldquo;your&rdquo; means you as the user of the Services. Our Services are provided to you only for private, non-commercial use.</p>
<p>2.Age and Accepting the Terms</p>
<p>Access to certain Services or features of the Services may be subject to age restrictions and not available to all users of the Services. The Services are only for users 13 years old and over (with additional limits that may be set forth in the Supplemental Terms – Jurisdiction-Specific). By accessing or using our Services, you confirm that you are over 13 and can form a binding contract with MSS, that you accept these Terms and that you agree to comply with them. You understand and agree that we will treat your access or use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onward.</p>
<p>If you are over 13 but under the legal age to enter into a contract in your jurisdiction, your parents or legal guardian must read and agree to these Terms. If you do not have consent from your parents or legal guardians, you must cease accessing or using the Services. If we learn that someone under the relevant age is using the Services, we will terminate access to the Service for such users.</p>

You must be at least 13 years of age to access or use the Services. If you are over 13 years of age but under 18 years of age, your parents or legal guardian must read and agree to these Terms.
​
If you are a &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; for the purposes of the Fair Trading Act 1986 and Consumer Guarantees Act 1993, nothing in these Terms operates to exclude, restrict or modify the application of any implied condition or warranty, provision, the exercise of any right or remedy, or the imposition of any liability under the Fair Trading Act 1986 or the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993.
​
For the purposes of Sections 5, 8, 11 and 12, if we wish to suspend or terminate your access, or licence to use, the Services (other than because you have failed to comply with any of the provisions of these Terms, or if activities occur on your account which, in our sole discretion, would or might cause damage to or impair the Services or infringe or violate any third party rights (including intellectual property rights), or violate any applicable laws or regulations), we will give you one months’ notice prior to such suspension or termination.

UNITED STATES
​
Section 18 “Other Terms” above is modified as follows:
​
This section replaces the “Applicable Law and Jurisdiction” portion of Section 18 above:
​
Applicable Law and Jurisdiction. These Terms, their subject matter and their formation, are governed by the laws of the United States and of the State of California. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may institute a proceeding for equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.
​
Agreement to Arbitration and Class Action Waiver. This section includes an agreement to arbitrate and an agreement that any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or prior versions thereof, including any question regarding existence, breach, interpretation, validity, enforcement, or termination of these Terms; the Services; the Game; MSS Content; your relationship with us; the threatened or actual termination of your access to the Services or Game payments made to you or payments made or allegedly owed to you; or any other claims (collectively, “Covered Matters”) will be brought in arbitration only in your individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative proceeding). Please read it carefully. You may opt out of the arbitration agreement by following the opt out procedure described below.
​
Informal Process First. You agree that in the event of any dispute over any Covered Matters between you and MSS, you will first contact MSS and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action. This is a condition precedent to proceeding in arbitration. To initiate the informal process, you must contact us at <a href="mailto:danielalexandru.radu@gmail.com">danielalexandru.radu@gmail.com</a> , and include your contact information and a written description of the dispute in the email. You must then allow sixty (60) days to pass, during which we will attempt to reach an amicable resolution of your issue.
​
Arbitration Agreement. After the informal dispute resolution process, any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, “Claim”) arising out of or relating in any way to any Covered Matters, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, except as expressly provided herein.
​
YOU UNDERSTAND, ACKNOWLEDGE, AND AGREE THAT YOU AND MSS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL FOR ANY AND ALL COVERED MATTERS, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.
​
This arbitration agreement applies equally to you and MSS. However, this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by MSS for infringement of its intellectual property or access to the Services that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these Terms or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures if the Claim and the parties are within the jurisdiction of such small claims court. If you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of the first of the date you access or use the Services by sending an email to <a href="mailto:danielalexandru.radu@gmail.com">danielalexandru.radu@gmail.com</a> with the subject line “Arbitration Opt-Out.”
​
You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement, and that you and MSS are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Arbitration Agreement will survive any termination of these Terms.
​
If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must send an email requesting arbitration and describing your claim to <a href="mailto:danielalexandru.radu@gmail.com">danielalexandru.radu@gmail.com</a>
​
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules including, if you are an individual, the AAA&rsquo;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. If you are not an individual or have used the Services on behalf of an entity, the AAA&rsquo;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used. The AAA&rsquo;s rules are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
​
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA&rsquo;s rules. If you are an individual and have not accessed or used the Services on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse those fees for claims where the amount in dispute is less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
​
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence will not apply to the “Class Action Waiver” section below.
​
This section replaces the “Class Action Waiver” portion of Section 18 above:
​
Class Action Waiver. You acknowledge and agree that any Claim must be brought in the respective party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (“Class Action”) except that an individual may seek in the arbitration public injunctive relief, and the AAA may include such relief in the award, where applicable. You and MSS mutually and expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.
​
If this Class Action Waiver is found to be unenforceable such that certain Covered Matters must proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such Covered Matters must be litigated in state or federal civil court of competent jurisdiction, not in arbitration. You and MSS further agree that such Covered Matters will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration between you and MSS. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and MSS each waive any right to a jury trial.
​
This section is amended to Section 18 above:
​
Exports. You agree that you will not export or re-export, directly or indirectly the Services and/or other information or materials provided by MSS hereunder, to any country for which the United States or any other relevant jurisdiction requires any export license or other governmental approval at the time of export without first obtaining such license or approval. In particular, but without limitation, the Services may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S. comprehensively embargoed countries or any country that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country (currently: Cuba, Crimea, Iran, North Korea, Syria), (b) to any governments of such countries, or (c) to anyone listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties, including the U.S. Treasury Department&rsquo;s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Person’s List or Entity List.</p>
