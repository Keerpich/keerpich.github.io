​</li>
<li>California Specific Information
California Privacy Rights
The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) and the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”) provides California residents the right to request:
•      Disclosure of our practices: The categories of Personal Information we collect, the categories of sources from which the Personal Information is collected, our purpose(s) for collecting the Personal Information, the categories of third parties with whom we have shared Personal Information, whether Personal Information is “sold” to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration or “shared” with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising, and the length of time we retain each category of Personal Information, or if that is not possible, the criteria we use to determine the retention period, among other information.
•      Access to specific pieces of your Personal Information we have collected.
•      Correction of any incomplete or inaccurate details in your Personal Information we have collected.
•      Deletion of any of your Personal Information we have collected.
•      To opt out of “sale” and “sharing”: request that your Personal Information not be “sold” to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration or “shared” with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising. As noted above, we do not sell Personal Information to third parties, and we do not share your Personal Information with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising. Therefore, we do not provide an option to opt out of the sale or sharing of your Personal Information.
As required by the CCPA and CPRA, we will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights.
You may exercise your rights by sending a request to <a href="mailto:danielalexandru.radu@gmail.com">danielalexandru.radu@gmail.com</a>. We will acknowledge receipt of your request within 10 business days, and provide a substantive response or notify you of the reason and extension period within 45 days. Under the CCPA/CPRA, only you or an authorised agent may make a request related to your Personal Information. We must verify your identity to respond to certain requests. We may do so by requiring you to log into the Game, provide information that matches information we’ve already collected about you (e.g., purchases, game statistics), or give a declaration as to your identity under penalty of perjury.
California’s Shine the Light Law
California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as “Shine The Light” law, permits California residents to annually request, free of charge, information about the disclosure of their Personal Information (if any) to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. We do not share Personal Information with third parties for such purposes.
Retention period
We shall retain your Personal Information for no longer than necessary for the purposes identified under this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is permitted or required by applicable law.
We use the following criteria to determine our retention periods:
•      our relationship with you;
•      the choices you make about your Personal Information;
•      whether we have a legal obligation to retain your Personal Information; and
•      whether retention of your Personal Information is otherwise advisable considering our legal position (i.e., with respect to applicable statutes of limitations, resolution of disputes, and the enforcement of our Terms of Service and this Privacy Notice).
​</li>
<li>Do we process Personal Information from children?
The Game is not intended for children under the age of 13 (under the age of 16 if you are in the EEA or in the UK) and we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information or personal data from children under 13 (under 16 if you are in the EEA or in the UK).
If you believe that we have personal information or personal data about or collected from a child under the relevant age, please contact us using the contact details specified at the end of this Privacy Notice and we will ensure that it is deleted.
​</li>
<li>What is the process of modification of the Privacy Notice?
We reserve the right to change this Privacy Notice at any time. In case there is a substantial change, we will notify you in this respect. If such change to the Privacy Notice requires your consent, you will have the choice to consent as to whether or not we may use your Personal Information in a different manner.
​</li>
<li>Who can you contact if you have queries?
If you have any query, you may contact us by email at the following address: <a href="mailto:danielalexandru.radu@gmail.com">danielalexandru.radu@gmail.com</a></li>
